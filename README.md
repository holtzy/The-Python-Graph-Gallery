   The Python Graph Gallery
===================

Overview
--------
Welcome to the Github Repository of the [**Python Graph Gallery**](https://python-graph-gallery.com/).

The [**Python Graph Gallery**](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/) is a website that showcases hundreds of graphics, all made using python. Charts are displayed in ~40 categories, and are always accompanied with their reproducible code. It allows users to quickly copy and paste a snippet of code and adapt it to their dataset.

The [**Python Graph Gallery**](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/) is a work developped by Yan Holtz during its nights, week-ends and holidays. Thus, please be indulgent if you find any bug, inconsistency or potential improvement. By definition, this project will never be finished (datavis possibilities are infinite!)



Contributing
--------
I would be really happy to receive new chart examples that you consider as missing to the gallery. Please note that they must respect certain features:  
- Code must be fully reproducible: a copy and paste must be enough to get the figure  
- Code must be as effective as possible AND well commented    
- Chart must be clearly different from the ones already existing  
- It is a plus if the chart is accompanied by a few explanation on how the code works  

Please send me any suggestion to yan.holtz.data@gmail.com OR add the code to the CONTRIBUTION folder through a pull request. Please note that I keep the decision to add the chart or not, since I want to keep the selection of the charts present in the gallery as efficient as possible.

Last but not least, you probably notices that my english is terrible. I apologize for that, and any mistake feedback is welcome!

Thank you very much for any contribution!



Charts re-utilization
--------
Feel free to reuse any of the chart displayed in the gallery at your convenience! However, please don't forget to **give credit** to this work by citing it! Most importantly, **add links** to the gallery since it allows the website to grow.



Acknowledgment
--------
There are many people I would like to acknowledge:
- Creators of [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org), [**Seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org), and [**Pandas**](http://pandas.pydata.org). Awesome tools, without them python would be way different, and the gallery would not exist. Sometimes, my examples can be close from their documentation, but I always link toward their webpages.
- Creators of other libraries and blog who accepted that I share their creations.
- People who already sent me some feedbacks / bug reports / proposition of improvement.
- People who said me thank you! Without that I would not developp this resource...

- My friend [**Guillaume Guimzu Debreu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-debreu-7b360b125/) without who I would never have had the Idea to make the galleries.
- My friend [**Conor Healy**](http://www.conor.fr/), best designer ever, who did the awesome set of Logo.
- My friend **Jean-Phi** for his precious advices.
- My wife **Mel Mulot** who bears me even when I code by night
- All my english speaker friends who correct me with patience (Lou Pap√©ou, Annie-Rose, Cherelle, Kath, Shenfa)
