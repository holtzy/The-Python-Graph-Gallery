# Watching Paint Dry

The composited _color_ of the **paint** must not change during drying. The
optical blending function is used with this constraint to compensate for the new
dry layer $C_{d}^{\prime}$, when some volume $\delta_{\alpha}$ is removed from
the wet layer.

$$
C_{d}^{\prime} = \\frac{\alpha}{}
$$

The dry layer of the canvas uses a relative height field to allow for unlimited
volume of paint to be added, with a constraint only on the relative change in
height between texels.
