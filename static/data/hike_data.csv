The result was worthy of the name. But the ""geyser"" did not last, and the flame, at first several feet high, soon dwindled to a few inches. Today, even that is gone.

Upon arrival at Talapus, break out lunch or pitch camp. Either way, you can cool off in the large lake. If you feel like pressing on, Ollalie Lake is just about a mile and a half up trail, where open campsites offer lakeside havens with calm waters and views of a beautiful lake basin."
Sultan River Canyon Trail,Central Cascades -- Stevens Pass - West,"4.0 miles, roundtrip",900,1700.0,3.50,"If you don’t mind descending first, then ascending later, the Sultan River Canyon trail is a nice alternative for the shoulder season when snow is still too deep in the mountains.

Pyramid Lake,North Cascades -- North Cascades Highway - Hwy 20,"4.2 miles, roundtrip",1500,2500.0,3.60,"This is a nice, quiet little forest hike, where the journey is half the destination. The lake is pond sized, and surrounded by large boulders. It is pretty in its own way, a still lake with nice reflections, yellow waterlilies and silvered logs floating on the surface. The clumps of grasses and moss growing on the floating logs create a mini ecosystem to observe up close."
Peshastin Pinnacles State Park,Central Cascades -- Leavenworth Area,"1.5 miles, roundtrip",400,1450.0,3.20,"Largely used as a climbing park, Peshastin Pinnacles also makes an ideal stop on Highway 2 to stretch your legs, or as a destination during a visit to Leavenworth, Wenatchee, Cashmere or Chelan. A short trail system offers a nice zigzag, moderately steep loop tour of the base of the climbing areas, and a picnic area makes for a great way to finish the visit off."
Poo Poo Point,Issaquah Alps -- Tiger Mountain,"7.2 miles, roundtrip",1858,2021.0,3.82,"Hike railroad grades dating from the logging era. Cross many small creeks, some of them seasonal.

Pinnacle Lake,North Cascades -- Mountain Loop Highway,"3.8 miles, roundtrip",1200,3800.0,3.09,"A short, but rough hike to two small lakes on the eastern slope of Mount Pilchuck. The first, Bear Lake is under a half mile from the trailhead on a good trail. Once on the way to Pinnacle, however, the trail changes to a rocky, rooty, muddy mess, slow going up, and slow coming down. The reward for putting up with this mess of a trail, is a nice quiet little lake ringed by rocks and trees, usually not crowded, even on a sunny Saturday."

Paul Peak,Mount Rainier Area -- NW - Carbon River/Mowich,"6.2 miles, roundtrip",900,3700.0,3.22,"An unconventional hike that starts downhill and finishes uphill, the Paul Peak Trail never climbs its namesake.

Peek-a-Boo Lake,North Cascades -- Mountain Loop Highway,"5.0 miles, roundtrip",1500,4350.0,3.14,"Enjoy a swim in a nice quiet lake surrounded by forest. Due to the narrow road, lack of spectacular scenery and few campsites, this lake does not get as many visitors as other hikes in the area do. The trail receives little maintenance so it is a bit rough, but it is easily followed."
Pear Lake,Central Cascades -- Leavenworth Area,"13.0 miles, roundtrip",2200,5200.0,3.71,"An aptly-named alpine gem, Pear Lake nestles below Fortune Mountain and can be reached by combining the Top Lake Trail with a short jaunt north on the Pacific Crest Trail.

The trail switchbacks through a forest of alder down to a forest of big leaf maple draped with lush mosses, liverwort and licorice fern. The forest floor is thick with fern and colorful salmonberry. Watch the kids! The Stilliguamish runs swift and deep here, especially during periods of high water flow. It is not recommended to continue on to the old railroad tunnels due to trail washout, slope slump and rockfall."

Old Wagon Road Trail,Central Washington -- Grand Coulee,"1.8 miles, roundtrip",550,2300.0,2.75,"From the same trailhead as Northrup Canyon, the Old Wagon Road Trail heads high, rather than into the canyon.

Accessible from both the Stehekin valley and Highway 20, many people blaze past this side trip on their way along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). But if you choose to explore this branch, you'll be rewarded with stunning mountain valleys at the base of Mount Logan, one of many striking peaks in the North Cascades. Of course, you'll have to share the trail with brush, bugs, and maybe even bears to get there."
North Fork Sauk River,North Cascades -- Mountain Loop Highway,"11.0 miles, roundtrip",1000,2800.0,2.86,"Some trails go to lakes, some to high viewpoints. This trail is all about the forest, and what a forest it is! Old-growth trees reach for the sky on either side of a brush-free trail, since understory is minimal when the big old trees block out the light. Find fantastic mushrooms here in the fall and forest wildflowers in the spring and early summer."
Nooksack Cirque,North Cascades -- Mount Baker Area,"9.0 miles, roundtrip",640,2840.0,3.00,"This unique, low-elevation hike follows the North Fork Nooksack River to spectacular scenery near the base of Mount Shuksan.

Mount Forgotten,North Cascades -- Mountain Loop Highway,"13.0 miles, roundtrip",4300,6005.0,4.23,"Mount Forgotten is an appealing target for the peculiarly determined hiker-turned-climber. Its sheer wall of a summit is very striking and easily instills visions of alpinism in those headed to Mount Forgotten Meadows, but the route takes a roundabout journey that requires not so much vertiginous daring-do as it does oodles of patience. The views from the top are spectacular, particularly the unobstructed view straight up Glacier Peak."
Mount Beljica,Mount Rainier Area -- SW - Longmire/Paradise,"3.0 miles, roundtrip",1056,5469.0,4.36,"Mount Beljica is just outside the boundary of Mount Rainier National Park, so you can bring your dog and still experience a well-kept trail leading to astounding views of Washington's tallest mountain."

The first fire lookout here was established in 1916; a lowly tent perched on the peak until a cabin with a cupola was built in 1922. This was hit by lightning in 1927 and a second lookout was built, but it was subsequently destroyed in 1965 and never rebuilt. Remains of these structures can still be seen on the mountain, when you can tear yourself away from the view."
Mirror Lakes,Mount Rainier Area -- SW - Longmire/Paradise,"14.0 miles, roundtrip",3900,5400.0,3.17,"Just a short jaunt from the cabin at Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds is Mirror Lakes, a beautiful little tarn that, in the right weather, reflects Rainier's west-facing slopes beautifully."

Monogram Lake,North Cascades -- North Cascades Highway - Hwy 20,"9.8 miles, roundtrip",4675,5719.0,3.44,"This gem of an alpine lake, situated in a cirque beneath the glaciated summit of Little Devil Peak, is ringed by verdant meadows and frequented by resident wildlife."
Moraine Park - Mystic Lake,Mount Rainier Area -- NW - Carbon River/Mowich,"25.4 miles, roundtrip",4400,6100.0,3.00,"Mystic Lake is a charming emerald tarn nestled in a subalpine basin along the Wonderland Trail. A scenic saddle separates it from Moraine Park, an expansive mountain meadow threaded with gurgling brooks under the dome of Mount Rainier.

From mile-high, miles-long alpine meadows, the river meanders. And so will you upon reaching these heavenly flower gardens.

Batey-Bould,Eastern Washington,"38.2 miles, roundtrip",2000,4400.0,2.75,"The Batey-Bould Trail System is 40 miles of motorcycle tracks in the summer and snowmobile tracks in the winter, but it is also a lovely walk through the forest for hikers/snowshoers who go during the week and avoid the motorists."

It is a nice off season walk though, and is perfect on a crisp, clear winter day. With the leaves off the trees, views that aren't possible in summer emerge; the surrounding peaks and the mossy green silhouettes of the leafless maple trees cover the hillside. A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction."

Entering the large parking area at the Red Town trailhead (one of several in this 3,100-acre regional park) it’s hard to imagine that what is today a lush green forest was once a busy coalmine operation.
